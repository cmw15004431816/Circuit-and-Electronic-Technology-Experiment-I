# Circuit-and-Electronic-Technology-Experiment-I

This repository contains my personal experiment reports and templates for “电路与电子技术实验 I (Circuit and Electronic Technology Experiment I)” It includes:

- Two HTML templates ([template-1.html](./template-1.html) and [template-2.html](./template-2.html)) for creating experiment reports.
- My personal experiment report files (`实验报告x—...html`, `實驗報告x—...md`).
- A Node.js [script](./script.js) using Puppeteer to convert HTML files to PDF.
- One `img` folder that contains all pictures used in the reports.
- One `pdf` folder that contains my reports and the two templates in PDF format.

## Usage

1. Download and use the [template-1.html](./template-1.html) or [template-2.html](./template-2.html) to create your own report, you can edit the templates to make it fit your needs.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed.  
3. Install Puppeteer:  

   ```bash
   npm install puppeteer
   ```

4. Modify the paths in script.js as needed.
5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   node script.js
   ```

6. The generated PDF will appear at the specified output path.

Note: The [script.js](./script.js) file contains very detailed comments and you should read it carefully and follow the instructions in the file. If you encounter some issues or you want some enhancements, remember that **AI tools** are always there to help you, feel free to ask AI!
